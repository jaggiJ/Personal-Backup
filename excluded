# Assumes source file to be /home/". if the pattern ends with a / then it will
# only match a directory, not a regular file, symlink, or device. if the pattern
# starts with a / then it is anchored to a particular spot in the hierarchy of
# files, otherwise it is matched against the end of the pathname. This is
# similar to a leading ^ in regular expressions. Thus "/foo" would match a name
# of "foo" at either the "root of the transfer" (for a global rule) or in the
# merge-file's directory (for a per-directory rule). An unqualified "foo" would
# match a name of "foo" anywhere in the tree because the algorithm is applied
# recursively from the top down; it behaves as if each path component gets a
# turn at being the end of the filename.
